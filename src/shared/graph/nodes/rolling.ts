/**
 * Rolling — turns an object's own movement into the spin a ball rolling on
 * the ground without slipping would have, so a sphere driven by Location
 * looks like it's actually rolling there instead of sliding while it spins
 * on noise.
 *
 * Unlike Velocity (`math/velocity`), which only ever reports the current
 * instant, a rolling ball's orientation is the *sum* of every bit of travel
 * since it started — so this keeps its own running rotation (a quaternion,
 * not degrees-per-frame) and adds to it, the same "state has to survive
 * between evaluate() calls" shape Trail keeps its sample history in.
 *
 * Per frame: the displacement since the last read is flattened onto the
 * rolling plane (whatever moved along Axis is climbing/falling, not
 * rolling), rotated by Axis × displacement to get the physically correct
 * roll axis, and turned by distance / r_eff radians — the standard
 * rolling-without-slipping relation. Reversing direction naturally unrolls
 * it; no separate "reverse" logic needed.
 *
 * `Size` is the shape's own natural dimension — a sphere's *diameter*, a
 * polygon's *side length* — and the node derives the radii from it
 * (r = size/(2·tan(π/N)), R = size/(2·sin(π/N))), so nobody has to compute
 * a cube's inradius themselves (s√3/2 is its circumradius, a different
 * number, which is exactly the kind of mistake this saves).
 *
 * With a polygonal `shape` (square, hexagon, ...) the same displacement is
 * turned into a *tumble*: the object tips over one edge at a time, so the
 * rotation per unit distance uses the polygon's effective radius
 * (r_eff = N·r·tan(π/N)/π, the rolling-without-slipping radius whose full
 * turn equals the polygon's perimeter), and its centre bobs with the tip —
 * up to the circumradius at the diagonal, down to the inscribed radius on
 * each flat. That bob is what couples a cube's vertical motion to its
 * rotation: wire `position` into the object's Location and it visibly rolls
 * instead of grinding along one face.
 *
 * This is a kinematic model — constant contact, uniform tip rate, a
 * sinusoidal bob — not the free-fall dynamics of a real tumbling cube. That
 * is the right trade for a tool where something else owns the motion: a
 * genuinely ballistic tumble would have to take the position over.
