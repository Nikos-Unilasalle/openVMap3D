 * Instance Positions — the bridge from Array (and anything else handing back
 * a Group of instances) to a plain Vector3 list, which is what most
 * points-consuming nodes actually want. Array only outputs the instanced
 * Group itself, with no position list alongside it — this is the "poles,
 * now give me a wire between them" node: wire Array's Geometry in here, wire
 * this node's Positions into Curve from Points' Points, add Sag.
 *
 * Height Offset exists for exactly that case: a pole's own origin is
 * usually its base (where it plants in the ground), not its top (where a
 * wire actually attaches) — this shifts every extracted position up (or
 * down) along Y, this app's up axis, without needing a second node.
