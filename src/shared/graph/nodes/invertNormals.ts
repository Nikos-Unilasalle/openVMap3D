/**
 * Invert Normals — turns a surface inside out.
 *
 * Two things decide which way a face points, and flipping only one of them
 * looks broken in a different way each time:
 *
 * - the **winding order** of each triangle, which is what backface culling
 *   reads. Flip only this and the far side of the object becomes the visible
 *   one, still lit as though it faced outward.
 * - the **normal vectors**, which are what lighting reads. Flip only these
 *   and the object keeps showing the same faces, now shaded as if the light
 *   were behind them.
 *
 * So "both" is the default and is what Blender's Flip Normals does. The two
 * halves are still offered separately because they answer different
 * questions — "why is my imported model inside out" is winding, "why is this
 * wall lit from the wrong side" is normals.

 * Which geometries this node currently has flipped.

 * bit for bit — so undoing needs no snapshot of the original arrays, just a
 * record of what was touched. That matters because this mutates geometry
 * owned by an upstream node and cached across frames: without the record,
 * deleting this node would leave the mesh inside out with nothing left in
 * the graph to explain why, and re-running it every frame would flip the
 * same geometry back and forth into a strobe.
