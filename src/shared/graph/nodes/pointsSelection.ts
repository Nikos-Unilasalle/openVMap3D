/**
 * Points Selection — a pick-list of indices into an incoming point set, made
 * by clicking/marquee-dragging the points in the 3D viewport when this node
 * is selected in the graph (see Viewport.tsx's points-edit gate, parallel to
 * the existing curve-handle one). `selectedIndices` lives as a plain param —
 * same storage convention as `pointsList` elsewhere — so a selection
 * survives save/load and undo/redo like any other param.
 *
 * Two ways to feed it points, so the whole "spring part of a mesh" workflow
 * can be either the explicit long form or a two-node shortcut:
 * - Points + Matrix (a Mesh to Points or Lattice Deform output plugged in).
 * - Geometry directly — this node does its own Mesh to Points extraction
 *   internally (same extractPointsFromMesh core) and additionally passes the
 *   original object through on `geometry`, which is what lets
 *   `OBJ -> Points Selection -> Spring Vector` skip both the separate Mesh
 *   to Points *and* Points to Mesh nodes: Spring Vector's own Geometry input
 *   (see spring.ts) reads that passthrough and writes its result straight
 *   back into a mesh, with no points-list plumbing visible to the operator.
 * Geometry wins if both are wired — it's not a sensible thing to wire both.
 *
 * Outputs `mask`, not the index list itself, because that's what Spring
 * Vector's Individual Points mode actually consumes: a same-length
 * 1-or-0-per-point array is a direct per-index lookup, whereas the index
 * list would make every consumer re-derive that lookup itself.
