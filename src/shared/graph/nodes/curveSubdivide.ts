/**
 * Curve Subdivide — inserts new points between each pair of consecutive
 * input points, the list-level counterpart of subdividing an edge loop: the
 * original points stay exactly where they were, only the gaps get denser.
 *
 * "Linear" inserts are a straight lerp per segment. "Catmull" samples a
 * CatmullRomCurve3 built through the whole input list instead of lerping —
 * a new point then lands *on* the smooth curve between its two neighbours,
 * not on the straight chord, which is what "subdivide" should mean for a
 * curve that isn't actually straight. This relies on CatmullRomCurve3's own
 * uniform per-segment parameterization (segment i of an open n-point curve
 * spans exactly t in [i/(n-1), (i+1)/(n-1)], or [i/n, (i+1)/n] closed) — the
 * one guarantee that makes "sample between two known anchors" reliable
 * without needing the curve to expose its own segment boundaries.
