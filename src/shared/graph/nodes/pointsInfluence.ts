 * Points Influence — like Points Selection, but graded: every point gets its
 * own 0-1 influence instead of a binary in/out, painted in the viewport
 * (see Viewport.tsx's pointsInfluenceHandles), all three gestures gated
 * behind Cmd/Ctrl+drag like every other viewport pick tool in this codebase
 * (curve marquee, Points Selection marquee) — a plain drag always stays
 * camera orbit, never hijacked by the active node's editing mode:
 * - Brush: Cmd+drag a stroke, influence falls off with distance from the
 *   cursor, capped at whichever of the 5 preset levels is armed.
 * - Discrete: the same 5 levels, but a flat assign — Cmd-click or
 *   Cmd-marquee writes the armed level exactly, no falloff.
 * - Gradient: Cmd-drag a single straight line once; every point's influence
 *   becomes its own projection onto that line (1 at the start, 0 at the
 *   end, linear in between) — a full-object dégradé in one stroke, e.g.
 *   top-to-bottom, independent of the 5 preset levels.
 *
 * `influences` stores only the non-zero entries (index -> 0-1), same sparse
 * convention as Points Selection's `selectedIndices` — a point nobody ever
 * touched defaults to 0 influence rather than needing an explicit entry.
 *
 * Outputs `influence`, not `mask`, but it's still a same-length numeric list
 * consumers read by index — Spring Vector / Wiggle Vector's Mask input (a
 * continuous 0-1 blend, not a binary threshold — see spring.ts/wiggle.ts)
 * and Extrude Mesh's per-vertex distance scale both accept it interchangeably
 * with Points Selection's own (0-or-1) mask output.
