/**
 * Points from Geometry Node — the read side of the x/y/z-list convention
 * Point Cloud, CSV Reader, and Particle Emitter (From Points) all share:
 * walks every mesh under the input geometry and hands back its *actual*
 * vertices as three flat lists, world-space (each mesh's matrixWorld is
 * applied, so a Transform upstream is reflected here rather than silently
 * dropped). The complement of Sample Surface (physics/sample), which
 * scatters random *area-weighted* points across a surface instead of
 * reading the mesh's own vertices — this node is for round-tripping real
 * geometry into the list/point-cloud world, not generating new points.
 *
 * Downsampled by even stride (not truncated) past Max Points so a coarse
 * cap still represents the whole mesh rather than just its first N
 * vertices in whatever order the geometry happens to store them.
