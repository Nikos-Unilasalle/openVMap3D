/**
 * Particles to Points Node — the bridge the particle system was missing.
 *
 * Every other pairing of types in this app already meets in the x/y/z list
 * format (Point Cloud, CSV Reader, Particle Emitter (From Points), Curve from
 * Points all speak it), and particles could already be *fed* from lists — but
 * nothing read their current state back out. The one existing particles→list
 * path, Capture Trails, hands back position *history*, which answers a
 * different question. This node answers "where are they right now", and with
 * it particles reach Point Cloud, Curve from Points, Spawner, and every list
 * node, without any of those learning anything about GPU textures.
 *
 * Only live particles are emitted, using the same `age >= 0` test
 * particles/render's own vertex shader uses for `vAlive` — a texel that is
 * dead or still inside its staggered pre-spawn delay is parked at the world
 * origin with no meaningful position, and including those would put a phantom
 * cluster at (0,0,0) in whatever consumes the list.
 *
 * Costs one GPU→CPU readback per frame (the same one connect-nearby and
 * capture-trails already pay, via the same cached helper).
