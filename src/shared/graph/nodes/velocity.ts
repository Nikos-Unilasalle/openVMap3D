 * internally, pulled out as its own reusable node: wire an object's Matrix
 * output in, get a Speed and Velocity Vector out, and drive anything with
 * it — Spring's Target for a wobble-on-stop effect, an emission rate, a
 * material's emissive intensity, whatever wants "how fast is this moving"
 * as a plain number instead of writing that measurement over again.
