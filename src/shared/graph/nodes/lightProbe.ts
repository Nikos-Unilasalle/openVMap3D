/**
 * Light Probe — samples the scene from a point and lights objects with what
 * it found there.
 *
 * A cube camera photographs all six directions from the probe's position; the
 * result is reduced to nine spherical-harmonic coefficients, which is enough
 * to reproduce smooth low-frequency lighting from every direction at once and
 * costs the shader almost nothing. That is the difference from an Ambient
 * Light: ambient is one flat colour from everywhere, a probe knows the wall on
 * its left is red and the sky above it is blue.
 *
 * What it captures is the scene as the last frame left it — walls, floor,
 * the environment background — so bounced colour comes for free without any
 * global-illumination machinery. What it can't do is vary across an object:
 * one probe is one point in space, and everything lit by it gets the same
 * nine coefficients.

 * and re-baking a static room every frame throws that away.

 * graph photographs an almost empty world and comes back black — which is
 * exactly what it did until the signature below started counting the scene's

 * the scene fills, and picks up an object added later, at the cost of one
