/**
 * Squash & Stretch Node — automatic, velocity-driven deformation. The object is
 * stretched along its direction of motion (and squashed perpendicularly,
 * volume-preserving) proportionally to its speed, with a single Intensity knob.
 * Wire `time` from the clock so the node can measure per-frame velocity; the
 * deformation settles back to identity the moment the object stops.
 *
 * Smoothing/Bounciness run the stretch amount through a damped spring instead
 * of applying the speed-derived target instantly. Both default to 0, which
 * collapses the spring to a direct pass-through — byte-identical to this
 * node's behaviour before they existed. Dialling in Bounciness makes that
 * spring underdamped, so it doesn't just lag the target, it *overshoots* past
 * it — and since the target is "stretch amount," overshooting past a target
 * that just dropped to 0 (a sudden deceleration) means the spring swings
 * negative for a moment. A negative stretch amount is a squash: compressed
 * along the direction of travel, bulged perpendicular, same volume-preserving
 * math as the stretch case. That single mechanism is deliberately what
 * produces the "hard stop squashes the object" look, rather than a second,
 * separate acceleration-triggered code path.
