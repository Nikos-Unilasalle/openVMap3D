 * Matrix Transform nodes, and going from a world matrix back to a local one
 * was not expressible at all.
 *
 * - **multiply** — `A × B`: B happens first, then A. The parent × child order,
 *   so wire the parent into A.
 * - **multiply-reverse** — `B × A`, for when it is the other way round.
 * - **delta** — `A⁻¹ × B`: the transform that takes you *from* A *to* B. Feed
 *   an object's matrix and a target's, and out comes the move between them.
 * - **inverse** — undoes a transform: world space back into A's local space.
 * - **transpose** — the rotation-only inverse, and the row/column swap that
 *   some imported data needs.
 * - **mix** — blends A into B by Factor, rotations included (see mixMatrices).
