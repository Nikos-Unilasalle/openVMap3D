/**
 * Registry of every per-node cache, so deleting a node can actually drop the

 *
 * Nodes that own something a pure `evaluate` can't hand back fresh each frame
 * — a THREE.Mesh the viewport keeps in its scene, a loaded texture, a
 * flip-flop's remembered state — keep it in a module-level Map keyed by the
 * node's id (see the `EvalContext.nodeId` doc). Nothing used to clear those
 * on deletion, which was more than the memory leak it was filed as: node ids
 * are *stable*, saved into .ovm files and restored identically by undo, so a
 * node that came back with its old id silently picked its old mesh, texture
 * or toggle state back out of the cache. Deleting a node and re-adding it
 * looked like it "remembered" the previous values because it genuinely did.
 *
 * Caches keyed by anything other than a node id (a sprite name, a file path)
 * must NOT be registered here — they are shared across nodes on purpose.
